# credit-risk-classification

Machine learning are used to analyze a dataset of lending activity.

## Overview Analysis

Factors in the analysis:
  - the size of the loan;
  - interest rate,
  - the income,
  - the debit to income ratio,
  - number of accounts,
  - total debit,

This intial model was drawing from a dataset that had 75,036 low-risk loan data points and 2,500 high-risk data points.

## Analysis

### Logistic Regression Model training:

Precision: 100% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 86% precise in predicting high-risk loans)
Accuracy: 99%
Recall: 100% (an average--the model had 100% recall in predicting low-risk loans, but 90% recall in predicting high-risk loans)

### Logistic Regression Model testing:

Precision: 100% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 85% precise in predicting high-risk loans)
Accuracy: 99%
Recall: 99% (an average--the model had 99% recall in predicting low-risk loans, but 91% recall in predicting high-risk loans)
